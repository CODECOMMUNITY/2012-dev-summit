### Aol Campus, Dulles VA

The [inaugural jQuery Developer Summit](http://events.jquery.org/2012/developer-summit)!

We're using this repo primarily for the [wiki](https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki), where we're keeping track of [who's working where](https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki/Roster) and what you'll need to have set up to be effective, and for the [issues](https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit), where we're tracking each team's to-dos and tasks. Whether or not you're actually attending the Summit in person, we welcome your input and ideas for what you'd like to see come out of two days of 120 people in the same room all working on different aspects of the jQuery project!
